# Aimi - Beautiful Frozen Vanilla

Aimi is a color-scheme meant to be used in multiple environments while looking  beautiful at the
same time. The theme comes in two variants, a light one inspired by Solarized light and a dark one
inspired primarily by glaciar themes like Oceanic and Nord.

## Currently in Development

Aimi is not yet finished yet. The colors aren't finalized and still need a bit of tweaking and
support is far from finished. Some planned targets are:

- Gnome Terminal
- Tilix
- Visual Studio Code

Any contribution in any form is welcome!
