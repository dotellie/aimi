# Aimi - A sensible color scheme

Aimi is a color-scheme meant to be used by all sorts of people in any kind of environment while
seamlessly blending form and function. The theme comes in both a light and a dark variant.

## Currently in Development

Aimi is not yet finished yet. The colors aren't finalized and still need a bit of tweaking and
support is far from finished. Some planned targets are:

- Gnome Terminal
- Tilix
- Visual Studio Code
- Alacritty
- ... and more!

## Developing

All source code lives in the `src/` directory and the `package.json` file. Everything else is auto
generated and is only there to facilitate easy installation for various platforms. As an example,
vim plugin managers usually install directly from a GitHub repository and look for their respective
files in the root directory. Because of this, everything not in the `src/` folder has to be
autogenerated and the `npm run generate` command needs to before every commit.

Any contribution in any form is welcome!
